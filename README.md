# tweets-to-roam

This project was built to format the Twitter data on a importable
format for [Roamresearch](http://roamresearch.com).

## Usage

First you need to [ask Twitter for your
data](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive),
and them you can start to use this project.

After get your data you can clone this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:squiter/tweets-to-roam
cd tweets-to-roam
```

### Generating the CSV file

To generate the CSV you can use a helper function of this project:

```shell
bin/generate-csv <unziped-twitter-data>/data/tweets.js generated.csv
```

Arguments:
1. The `tweet.js` file from Twitter
1. The file that you'll use in the next step

#### Customizing the content of the CSV

In this `bin/generate-csv` you have a lot of `grep -v` statements, you
can add anything that you want to exclude for the CSV in a new line.

It's important to notice that the default file is customized for **my
usage!**.

### Generating the Roamresearch's compatible json

Run the project directly, via `:exec-fn`:

```shell
clojure -X:run-m <unziped-twitter-data/data/tweet.js> > file-to-import.json
```

This command will generate a json file with this format:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "September 9th, 2008",
    "children": [
      {
        "string": "21:56 Your tweets #[[My Tweets]]"
      },
      {
        "string": "22:01 Other tweet for the same day. #[[My Tweets]]"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "title": "September 5th, 2008",
    "children": [
      {
        "string": "09:01 another day tweet #[[My Tweets]]"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
